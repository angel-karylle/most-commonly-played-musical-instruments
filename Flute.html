        <p>In comparison to other musical instruments, the flute has an extremely simple structure. The popularity of the flute peaked in the nineteenth century. Its popularity stems from the simplicity of its mechanics and the unique tune it produces. 
            The melody of a flute, according to flute fans, touches the delicate regions of the listener's brain. Its basic yet beautiful tunes heal the troubled heart and mind.</p>

        <p>The flute fingerings and care of the instrument are easy to handle. Producing sound and playing the more challenging music associated with the flute, however, is a challenge for some. Fortunately, it's easy to work around these with the right help.</p>

          <p>A flute can be described as a woodwind instrument, generally of a tubular shape, that is played by blowing across a specially-shaped opening (known as the embouchure) in such a way as to produce 
            a vibrating column of air whose pulsations we hear as sound.</p>
